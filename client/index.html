                <h1>What's at Stake in Trump's Proposed E.P.A. Cuts</h1>
                <div>The Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Environmental 
                Protection Agency budget are deep and wide-ranging. It seeks to shrink 
                spending by 31 percent, to $5.7 billion from $8.1 billion, and to 
                eliminate a quarter of the agency's 15,000 jobs. The cuts are so deep 
                that even Republican lawmakers are expected to push back. Senator 
                Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the chairwoman of the Interior and Environment 
                Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, pointedly reminded 
                Mr. Trump last month that his budget request was just “the first step in 
                a long process.”</div>
